Memory related vulnerabilities are very dangerous. To prevent such vulnerabilities programmers can employ safe memory management practices such as:
- Functions that control the amount of data read into the memory
- Input and input size validation
- Using constants for buffer sizes
- Paying attention to comparison operators while reading into the memory
- Avoiding input in a format string
